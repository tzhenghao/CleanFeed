CleanFeed
=========

Introduction
------------
Fetches news from all over the Internet and puts them together in a centralized
feed for easy consumption.

Technologies used:
-----------------
1. AngularJS (web).
2. Xcode, Android Studio (IDEs used for developing mobile app versions).
3. Spring framework (Acts as a glue for dependency injection in the whole system).
4. Gradle ( a better Make for Java :) )
5. Hibernate ORM (not so sure about this one yet - but for now it maps to a SQL db).
6. Apache Cassandra (NoSQL db for faster and easier deployment).
7. Apache Thrift (for cross-platform compatibility when communicating with Cassandra).
8. Git (VCS).
9. Google Translate API (to translate the different languages from various news
sources into English).

FAQ
---
1. Any chance of seeing a mobile app for this? 
- Yes, absolutely! Once the web version is up, I will continue to work on an Android
and then an iOS application for this.
